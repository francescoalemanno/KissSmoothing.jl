# KissSmoothing.jl

This package implements a smoothing procedure

    denoise(V::Array; factor=1.0, rtol=1e-12, dims=N, verbose = false)

smooth data in `V` according to:

    `V` : data to smooth

    `factor` : smoothing intensity

    `rtol` : relative tolerance on how precise the smoothing intensity is determined

    `dims` : array dimension being smoothed

    `verbose` : enables some printing of internal info

returns a tuple (S,N) where:

    `S` : is the smoothed data

    `N` : is the extracted noise

in particular `S + N` reconstructs the original data `V`.
